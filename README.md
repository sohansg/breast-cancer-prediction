# 🧠 Breast Cancer Prediction using Neural Networks (PyTorch)

## 📌 Overview
This project builds a neural network using **PyTorch** to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign based on medical diagnostic data.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: [UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))
- Features: 30 real-valued input features
- Target: Diagnosis (`M` = Malignant, `B` = Benign)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `.ipynb` file using Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all cells to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate accuracy.

## 📈 Results
The model achieves high classification accuracy and demonstrates effective use of PyTorch for binary classification tasks.
